Against this backdrop, we evaluate the “Leezenflow” system, a green wave assistant designed specifically for cyclists and is installed 110 meters in front of a traffic light in Münster, Germany. The system indicates the remaining time of the current traffic light phase through an expiring bar. This is intended to help cyclists adjust their speed in order to cross the traffic lights when green, and consequently optimize their cycling flow. We conduct a natural field experiment to analyze the system’s impact on cycling flow and safety, and find a statistically significant impact on cycling flow. The number of cyclists that have to stop at the red lights decreases by 6.6 %. The data also indicate positive effects on traffic safety. The results of the natural field experiment confirm and put into perspective the feedback of an accompanying online survey. The Leezenflow system can thus help city planners to promote cycling, thereby enabling more sustainable mobility.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Riding the Green Wave - How Countdown Timers at Bicycle Traffic Lights Impact on Cycling Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Hagedorn","Till Kösters","Sebastian Specht","Jan Wessel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1699833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699833600,"objectID":"82a79d4a12f94a2873c18a4b9f3642ca","permalink":"https://jan-wessel.github.io/publication/speed-price/","publishdate":"2023-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/speed-price/","section":"publication","summary":"We estimate the relationship between fuel prices and driving speeds on the German Autobahn.

There are ambiguous effects for cycling, which decreases in cities with a higher modal share of cycling, and increases in others.

We find that the g/€ indicator induces people to be more likely to choose the travel alternative with the lower indicator value.

We also find that the steering effect of the g/€ indicator is stronger than for other emission indicators, especially for the costs of offsetting emissions.

Using data from 122 automated bicycle counting stations in 30 German cities, and a composite index of adverse weather conditions that consists of air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and cloud coverage, we calculate city-specific weather elasticities of the level of utilitarian cycling. The results show that these weather elasticities vary significantly between cities. Our next step is to analyze various determinants of weather elasticities, which reveals that the share of young inhabitants and the density of the cycle network have a positive impact on weather resilience. Based on the notion that resilience to adverse weather conditions reflects a revealed part of a city's bicycle culture, the weather elasticities can be used to create a ranking of bicycle cities. This ranking is positively correlated with a ranking based on the modal share of cycling, as well as with other rankings based on stated preference surveys or external conditions such as infrastructure or cycling safety.","tags":null,"title":"Some people feel the rain, others just get wet: An analysis of regional differences in the effects of weather on cycling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Wessel","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The results show that both actual and forecasted weather conditions can be used as useful explanatory variables for predicting bicycle usage. Even incorrect weather forecasts can impact on bike ridership, which underlines the importance of weather forecast effects for traffic planners; for example, forecasted rain can reduce bike traffic by 3.6% in periods that turn out to be rain-free. Additionally, a digital image-processing method is used to calculate the darkness of the cloud coverage displayed on weather forecast maps. The results imply that bike ridership is significantly smaller in regions with darker forecasted clouds. It is also shown that weather forecasts have a stronger impact on recreational bike traffic than on utilitarian traffic. Furthermore, various lagging and leading effects of rain forecasts are outlined. Morning rain forecasts can, for example, reduce bike ridership in midday and afternoon hours that were predicted to be rain-free. To derive these results, hourly bicycle counts from 188 automated counting stations in Germany are collected for the years 2017 and 2018. They are linked to actual weather data from Germany’s National Meteorological Service and with historical weather forecasts that are deduced from weather maps of Germany’s most-watched television news program.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantify the direct and indirect economic growth effects of newly created TEN-T core corridor roads in Eastern European countries. Both the panel data and the spatial analyses show that regional GDP growth at the NUTS3 level is between 0.5 and 2.0 percentage points higher, if a region has direct access to a newly built road. The analyses with a Durbin model (SDM) show that the new construction of a TEN-T core road also causes positive spillover effects on other regions that have direct access to the corridor network, as well as on regions that are not directly connected to the corridors. The results thus indicate that the TEN-T policy, which aims to alleviate transport bottlenecks, can increase cohesion between central and peripheral regions and consequently enhance regional welfare in Eastern Europe.","tags":null,"title":"TEN-T corridors – Stairway to heaven or highway to hell?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Strong trade increases are found for survey-based quality indicators of airport and railroad infrastructure. For road trade, the road density is more important than the quality of road infrastructure. Additionally, the infrastructure quality of transit countries is an important trade flow driver of the land transport modes road and railroad. For the analysis of these effects, I use a gravity equation model with European trade flows that are disaggregated over five different transport modes. In combination with the quality and quantity indicators for each corresponding type of transport infrastructure, it is possible to directly estimate the unique trade effects for each infrastructure type. Moreover, a novel cross-mode analysis is conducted to estimate interdependencies and cross-effects that exist between different transport infrastructure types and different transport modes.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the transport-mode-specific trade effects of different transport infrastructure types","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Wessel"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!
